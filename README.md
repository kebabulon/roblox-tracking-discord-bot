# how to use the bot
Hello! Heres a quick guide how to use this bot.
1. To run the bot you need to change stuff in settings. You can find setting.json in dist folder. Open it and change this.

	"discordBotClientToken": your discord bot token. If you don't know how to get it, heres a good tutorial how to make it! https://youtu.be/nW8c7vT6Hl4?t=254.
	
	"whoCanUseBot": if you want so everyone can use the bot, set this to "everyone". If you want so only you can use the bot, set this to "yourDiscordName#yourTag".
	
	"refreshingInterval": this is delay of checking user's status, i recommend set it to 5.
	
	"sentTrackingMessagesChannel": channel id there you want bot to send messages in, just google on how to get the id of a channel.
	
	"mentionUser": set this to true if you want bot to mention you when user status changes.
	
2. After that just run the robloxUserTracker.exe and the bot is done!

# commands
.track "roblox profile link" - start tracking user.

.stoptrack - stops tracking.
